# Workspace Launcher
This is a utility program that boots up all your workspace applications to start development work on Inferris.

It needs a cleanup really badly.

## Configuration
Upon bootup, it will generate a configuration file. Fill out the information with your path locations.

If using Windows, be sure you're using double "\\" for directories. Example: `C:\\Users\\refrizor\\Desktop\\Servers\\Proxy`
